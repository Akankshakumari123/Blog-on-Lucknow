					  Historically, Lucknow was the capital of the Awadh region, controlled by the Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire. It was transferred to the Nawabs of Awadh. In 1856, the British East India Company abolished local rule and took complete control of the city along with the rest of Awadh and, in 1857, transferred it to the British Raj.[20] Along with the rest of India, Lucknow became independent from Britain on 15 August 1947. It has been listed as the 17th-fastest growing city in India and 74th in the world.

						Counted among the top historical places in Lucknow, Bara Imambara aka Asafi Imambara is a historical monument that dates back to 1784. Built by Asaf-ud-Daula, one of the renowned Nawabs of Awadh, the complex comprises a large mosque (Asfi Mosque), a labyrinth (the Bhul Bhulaiya), and a stepwell with running water (Shahi Baoli). The structure boasts of two large gateways that will lead you to the central hall, which is touted to be the largest vaulted chamber in the world. 
						Construction of Bara Imambara was started in 1780, a year of a devastating famine, and one of Asaf-ud-Daula's objectives in embarking on this grandiose project was to provide employment for people in the region for almost a decade while the famine lasted. It is said that ordinary people used to work in the day building up the edifice, while noblemen and other elite worked at night to break down anything that was raised that day. It was a project that preceded a Keynesian-like intervention for employment generation. Construction of the Imambara was completed in 1794. The estimated cost of building the Imambara ranges between half a million rupees to a million rupees. Even after completion, the Nawab used to spend between four and five hundred thousand rupees on its decoration annually.

							Chota Imambara, also known as Imambara Hussainabad Mubarak is an imposing monument located in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. It took 54 years to finalize it.
							 Built as an imambara or a congregation hall for Shia Muslims, by Muhammad Ali Shah, the Nawab of Awadh in 1838,[1] it was to serve as a mausoleum for himself and his mother, who is buried beside him.
                            The significance of Panjetan, the holy five, is once again emphasized here with five main doorways. This Imambara consist of two halls and a Shehnasheen (a platform where the Zarih of Imam Husain is kept.) Zarih is the replica of that protective grill or structure 
							which is kept on the grave of Imam Husain at Karbala, Iraq. The large green and white bordered hall of Azakhana is richly decorated with chandeliers and a good number of crystal glass lamp-stands. In fact, it was for this profuse decoration that the Imambara was referred by European visitors and writers as The Palace of Lights. The exterior is very beautifully decorated with Quranic verses in Islamic calligraphy

The Residency is located in the heart of the city, in the vicinity of other monuments like Shaheed Smarak, Tehri Kothi and High Court Building.
						</p>
						<p>The Residency has been maintained as it was at the time of the final relief, and the shattered walls are still scarred by cannon shot. Ever since Indian Independence, little has changed. The ruined building is now surrounded by lawns and flowerbeds and serves as a tourist attraction. The cemetery at the nearby ruined church has the graves of 2,000 men, women and children, including that of Sir Henry Montgomery Lawrence who died during the siege.The Ruins of the British Residency
							There is a weathered epitaph near the grave of Sir Henry that reads "Here lies the son of Empire who tried to do his duty" while another nearby grave reads "Do not weep my children, for I am not dead, but am sleeping here." A light and sound show to display the history of the Residency is also played each evening.</p>

							The Rumi Darwaza is also known as the Turkish Gate, in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India, is an imposing gateway which was built by Nawab Asaf-Ud-Daula in 1784.This massive gate is situated between Bara Imambara and Chota Imambara. This place is generally very much busy all day, and during weekends most of the tourists visit. The streets are redeveloped as it was earlier constructed of hard brick roadways.The design of the gate represents the most famous industry for which the city Lucknow itself is known for - 'Chikankaari'. When the gate is looked upside down it resembles the v shaped neckline used in chikan clothings. On the top of the gate some small pillars have been erected, they represent the spice- long which was used as one of the ingredients in "paan" of the Mughal kings.The gates were made massive so that when the emperor enters on his horses or elephants, they can easily come through. On further walking towards Bara Imambara, you can see brick roads that are still there and in use since the time they were constructed alongside the construction of its monuments. The Gate also has Matsya fishes engraved on it, that are also there in the state's (Uttar Pradesh's) emblem. The streets represent the very substance, of the city, hence Lucknow is also known as the 'City of Nawabs'. The people there are known for their tehzeeb (respect towards others) and their very fine manners. The Imambara is open to all people and people of all religions. They represent their faith to everyone without harming anyone. When you enter this place it is not about the beliefs, there's a peace of mind and body you can find. The Imambara is indeed a place to be visited and remembered. And the gate to this small paradise is the Roomi darwaza.
